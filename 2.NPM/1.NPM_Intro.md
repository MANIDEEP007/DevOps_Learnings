* NPM Stands for Node Package manager and is used in maintaining Java Script Projects
* **https://www.npmjs.com/** -â€”> This is the website where we can get the packages that are available in public
* **https://nodejs.org/en/** --> This is the website to download NPM
* NPM depends on the **package.json** file which will be present in the root folder of the project
* To create a public package or if different work should work on same project, NPM will be very much useful
* Note that for a new project, one can create the package.json manually or use NPM for it
* To create package.json using npm, goto root folder of the project and execute **npm init** command
* It opens an interactive session where it queries details like package name, version,description,keywords, git repository, license scheme etc
* Once all the details are given, package.json will be created at the root folder of the project
* If our project depends on some other packages, they can be mentioned in dependencies section along with desired version in package.json
* Generating package.json for a new project can be in next images in the post
