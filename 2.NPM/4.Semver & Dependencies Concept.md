### Dependency Versions Representations in package.json

##### For each dependencies in package.json for an project, the version can be in one of the following
* Exact version use like 5.21.17, means it needs dependency with exact version
* Minimum version like >5.21.1, means it needs dependency version of minimum 5.21.1 and greater than that
* Versions with compatible changes like ^5.21.8, means it needs dependency version of minimum 5.21.8 and less than 6.0.0 meaning last two digits can change
* Versions with Minor Level Changes like ~5.21.8, means it needs dependency version of minimum 5.21.8 and less than 5.22.0  meaning last digit can change

### Semver Package Functions:

* valid - Function that checks given version is valid or not
* gt - Check whether first version is greater than second one or not
* lt - Check whether first version is less than second one or not
* inc - Increments particular digit of version based on the second argument
* satisifies - Check whether first version is equal or in the range of the second argument version
* coerce - Expand short form of the version
