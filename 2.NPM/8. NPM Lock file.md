### NPM Lock file

* Lock file creation is present from Node V5.0.0
* Node takes care of updating package-lock.json whenever new package in installed or existing packages are updated
* As package-lock.json tracks versions of dependencies and its childs, it should be committed to source code management tool
* Note that, package-lock.json will not be published to software registry
* Helps in maintaining of consistency of dependency version of packages during installation
* In package-lock.json, for development dependency there will be another property namely **"dev": true**
