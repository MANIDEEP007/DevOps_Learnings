### NPM Some Info:
* If the package is being developed as **Stand alone browser App** then you can add all needed packages as **dependencies** or **development dependencies**
* If the package is public package and complied version of your package depends on features from other packages, add them under dependencies. Else add them under development dependencies
* package-lock.json helps in keeping track of versions of dependency packages along with its childs
* If there is no lock file and we try to do npm install, it will install latest version of package that satisfies the semver version in package.json
* **npm install package_name --save-exact** in current working directory -->  installs package and stores dependency with exact downloaded version in package.json
