* NPM Scripts are way to bundle the shell commands related to operation on application
* These will be defined the scripts section of the package.json file of the project
* **npm  init -y** by default defined test script as **"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"**  in package.json under scripts section
* **npm start** is another Default Script which runs node server.js if present in current working directory. Else, it throws error
* We can define custom script by adding entry in package.json scripts section. 
* Once defined, we can run it using **npm run <script_name>** or **npm run-script <script_name>**
* To run NPM Scripts simultaneously in parallel or serial fashion, one can install **npm-run-all** package and use it 

**Note:** For node scripts, its better to use **#!/usr/bin/env node** as first line and this is called as shebang
