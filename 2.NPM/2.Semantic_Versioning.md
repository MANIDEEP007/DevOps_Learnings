### Semantic Versioning
* Semantic Versioning is a Universal agreement useful in managing the packages and it depdencies
* As per this agreement, the version contains **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** and also followed by metadata like alpha or beta or rc when needed
* **MAJOR** --> Changing this MAJOR number means we are adding new features that are incompatible
* **MINOR** --> Changing this MINOR number means we are adding new features which are backward compatible in nature
* **PATCH** --> Changing this PATCH number means we are adding Bug fixes which are backward compatible in nature
* Label alpha means the product or package is ready for internal testing in the organization
* Label beta means the product or package is ready for testing to some external customers
* Label rc(release-candidate) means the product is almost ready for release
* Note that In case of same MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, **alpha < beta < rc**. A MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH can have multiple alpha, beta, rc
* MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH is greater than any of its alpha, beta or rc
### Examples of some version numbers:
1.2.0 --> MAJOR = 1, MINOR = 2, PATCH = 0
1.2.1-alpha --> MAJOR = 1, MINOR = 2, PATCH = 1
1.2.1-beta --> MAJOR = 1, MINOR = 2, PATCH = 1
1.2.1-rc --> MAJOR = 1, MINOR = 2, PATCH = 1
1.2.1-alpha.2 --> MAJOR = 1, MINOR = 2, PATCH = 1
1.2.1-beta.11 --> MAJOR = 1, MINOR = 2, PATCH = 1
1.2.1-rc.3 --> MAJOR = 1, MINOR = 2, PATCH = 1

**Note:** 1.2.0 < 1.2.1-alpha < 1.2.1-alpha.2 < 1.2.1-beta < 1.2.1-beta.16 < 1.2.1-rc < 1.2.1-rc.3 < 1.2.1
